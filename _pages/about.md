<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

RCSL is led by Dr. Shreejith Shanker and brings together researchers with the interests in application acceleration, computer architecture design, communication networks and embedded systems. Our vision is to explore the interplay between hardware and software, as well as computation and communication for reimagining and enhancing digital systems and infrastructure across different technology domains. The areas we explore in our research span from light weight embedded systems, architecture of in-vehicle safety-critical systems, energy-efficient architectures for deep neural network acceleration to high-quality image and video processing accelerators for post-production tasks.
